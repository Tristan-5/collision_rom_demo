# Collision-Statistical Reduced-Order Model Demo

This repository contains a lightweight Python demonstration of a collision-statistical reduced-order model (ROM) for turbulence-like fluctuations. The model illustrates how small-scale stochastic effects can accumulate statistically and produce scale-dependent velocity fluctuations without resolving the full flow field.

The goal is not to replace CFD, but to show how fast, low-dimensional statistical models can capture key fluctuation behavior relevant to prediction, design, and control.
